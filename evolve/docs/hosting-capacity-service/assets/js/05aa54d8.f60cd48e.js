How it Works","description":"The hosting capacity analysis uses time series power flows of a continuous model of the electricity distribution network, from the busbar of major substations at the Medium Voltage level (22kV or 11kV for example) to energy consumers connected to the Low Voltage (415 or 230 V) network, with one load flow calculation performed for each 30 minute interval in each day, over a multi-year forward planning horizon.","sidebar":"theSidebar"},"explanation/interventions-concepts":{"id":"explanation/interventions-concepts","title":"What are Interventions and why are they useful?","description":"Once constraints are identified, the HCM allows operators to explore strategies to resolve them through the Intervention Module. This module models changes to both system-wide and local conditions, enabling comparative analysis of mitigation options against the base case. The Intervention Module is a seperate module within the Energy Workbench platform, designed to work seamlessly with the HCM.
