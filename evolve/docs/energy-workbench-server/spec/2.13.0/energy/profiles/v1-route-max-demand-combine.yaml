    - Energy Profiles v1
  summary: Combine different energy profiles
  description: >
    The combine API will produce a single energy profile by performing the
    following steps:


    1. Creating a set of required points from the 'base' list

    2. Adding any points in the 'toAdd' list to the required points list
    that do not already exist.

    3. Removing all points in the 'toRemove' list from the required points
    list.

    4. Generate a max demand profile from the summation of profiles for all
    points in the required points list.

      Payload containing the parameters for the profile combination.


      Field | Description

      - | -

      name | The name of the result set. This will be used as the series name in
      the profile displays provided with the Energy Workbench.

      resultRatingKva | The rating in kVA for the resulting profiles.

      resultVoltage | The voltage of the resulting profiles.

      seeds | A list of assets/traces to be used as a seed for finding the
      maximum demand days.<br/><br/>When a seed is specified you cannot
      guarantee the results are for the actual maximum demand day, as the day
      with the coincident maximum demand may change with the addition/removal of
      load.<br/><br/>This is a performance optimisation allowing you to quickly
      rule out cases where a maximum demand is excessive (if a day that is not
      the maximum exceeds limits then so will the maximum). A follow-up call
      with no seeds should be performed to get the actual maximum demand days.

      seeds.from | The asset which has the profile, or the start of the trace.

      seeds.to | If a trace is performed this provides a stop asset. [optional]

      base | A list of assets/traces to use as the base of the result (minimum
      1).

      base.from | The asset which has the profile, or the start of the trace.

      base.to | If a trace is performed this provides a stop asset. [optional]

      toAdd | A list of assets/traces to add to the result base. Duplicates will
      be ignored.

      toAdd.from | The asset which has the profile, or the start of the trace.

      toAdd.to | If a trace is performed this provides a stop asset. [optional]

      toRemove | A list of assets/traces to remove from the result. Assets that
      are not part of the result base (after additions) will be ignored.

      toRemove.from | The asset which has the profile, or the start of the
      trace.

      toRemove.to | If a trace is performed this provides a stop asset.
      [optional]
